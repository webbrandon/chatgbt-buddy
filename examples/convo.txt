user1: hello everyone and thank you for coming today.  i would like to start off by saying the year has been good to us and we can make new investment opportunities.
user2: thats great to hear the extra effort we been putting in is paying off!
user3: I may even get to hang out with my wife and kids with all that behind us.
user1: Well thats not what I mean exactly, we worked hard to get here and have to keep it up in order to maintain it but because were doing so good we can make new acquisitions to expand.
user2: So you wold rather expand then invest in what we have built so the rest of us don't get burned out?
user1: No thats not what I mean at all.
user2: Well from what I am hearing it is and I am not okay with this.
user1: I am sorry you feel that way but this is my decsion to make and I am not asking more than you are currently doing.
user3: You don't understand the point I believe and don't realize that this expansion does require more of us and for one will not continue down this path.  I am giving my two weeks notice.
user1: Wait! what! why?
